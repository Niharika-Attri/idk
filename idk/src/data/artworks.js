        title: "Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son",
        artist: "Claude Monet",
        year: 1875,
        description: 'The artist’s wife Camille stands on a hill with their son Jean behind her. Monet worked quickly to record this moment. Sketching the sky in chaotic strokes of blue and gray, he left areas of canvas exposed in his haste. The grass is more densely painted in short brushstrokes of green, blue, and brown. Small dabs of yellow suggest buttercups, and the color is reflected on Camille’s sleeve. The dense slashes of brilliant white on the back of her skirt and jacket catch the light. Completed in a single outdoor session, this is a celebration of color and light.'
