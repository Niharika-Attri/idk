        artist: "Claude Monet",
        year: 1875,
        description: "The artist's wife Camille stands on a hill with their son Jean behind her. Monet worked quickly to record this moment. Sketching the sky in chaotic strokes of blue and gray, he left areas of canvas exposed in his haste. The grass is more densely painted in short brushstrokes of green, blue, and brown. Small dabs of yellow suggest buttercups, and the color is reflected on Camille's sleeve. The dense slashes of brilliant white on the back of her skirt and jacket catch the light. Completed in a single outdoor session, this is a celebration of color and light."

        title: "Bride's Toilet",
        artist: "Amrita Sher-Gil",
        year: 1937,
        description: "A work of modernism, the painting draws influence from the frescoes of Ajanta and the miniatures of Mughal art, thereby resulting in a masterful amalgam of Indian and European styles. Bride's Toilet depicts a bride's chamber, wherein a young light-skinned woman, presumably the titular bride, is seated. She is half-naked; her palms are covered in mehndi. She is surrounded by two other women and two children. Their faces are expressionless. Tones have been skilfully used. The painting demonstrates Sher-Gil's curious interest in women, their lives and adversities."

        title: "Shakuntala Patra-lekhan",
        artist: "Raja Ravi Varma",
        year: 1876,
        description: "Shakuntala Patra-lekhan is a painting by Raja Ravi Varma, depicting the moment when Shakuntala, the daughter of sage Vishwamitra and Menaka, is writing a letter to her husband Dushyanta. The painting captures the essence of Indian mythology and the beauty of Shakuntala's character.
